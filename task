Deliverables: Code + 5–6 min Video
Evaluation: 50% Code | 50% Video

The Challenge
You are building an integration layer between an ERP system and an AP automation
platform.
Your task is to design and implement a REST API service that can:
1. Synchronize master data:
○ Vendors
○ Tax Codes
○ Nominal Accounts
○ Departments
2. Ingest historical accounting entries:
○ Posted invoice headers
○ Invoice line items including VAT details
3. Guarantee reliability, idempotency, and consistency.

You are evaluated on integration architecture, data integrity, resilience, and production
readiness.

Dataset
You are given a CSV file with historical AP entries.
You may transform this into proper relational structures in your database.

Core Challenge

Real ERP integrations fail because of:
● Duplicate data
● Partial failures
● Mismatched tax codes
● Inconsistent vendor identifiers
● Race conditions
● Non-idempotent APIs
● Silent data corruption

The key question:
How do you design a REST API that can reliably synchronize financial data without
corrupting the system?

Functional Requirements
Your API must support:
1. Master Data Sync
Endpoints such as:
POST /vendors
POST /tax-codes
POST /accounts
POST /departments
Must support:
● Upsert behavior
● Idempotency
● External IDs
● Validation
● Version updates

2. Historical Entry Ingestion
POST /invoices
Payload example:
{
external_invoice_id,

vendor_external_id,
invoice_date,
lines: [
{
description,
net_amount,
tax_code_external_id,
nominal_external_id,
department_external_id
}
]
}
Must support:
● Idempotent posting
● Duplicate detection
● Referential integrity validation
● VAT validation
● Atomic transaction behavior
If one line fails validation, the entire invoice should fail.
3. Data Integrity Rules
Your system must:
● Validate VAT correctness
● Ensure tax code exists
● Ensure vendor exists
● Ensure account exists
● Reject inconsistent references
● Return structured error responses

Non-Functional Requirements
Your design must address:
● Idempotency keys
● Transaction management
● Retry safety
● Logging and traceability
● Clear audit trail
● Schema validation
● Error transparency

Bonus:
● Pagination for bulk sync
● Bulk ingestion endpoint

Code Requirements (50%)
Must include:
Python REST API implementation
Use any framework such as FastAPI or Flask
Required:
● Clear folder structure
● Data Models
● Validation layer
● Persistence layer
● Idempotency mechanism
● Transaction handling
● Proper HTTP status codes
● Structured error responses
● README
● requirements.txt

You may use SQLite or Postgres.
We Are Evaluating
● System architecture
● Clean separation of concerns
● Idempotent design
● Referential integrity handling
● Data validation robustness
● Production readiness thinking
● Logging clarity
● Trade-off awareness

AI Usage Policy
You are encouraged to use AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude Code, or similar assistants
during this assignment.

However:
● You must fully understand and be able to explain all submitted code.
● You must clearly describe how AI was used in your process.
● You must identify at least one instance where you reviewed, corrected, or improved
AI-generated output.
The goal is to assess not only your technical ability, but also your judgment and
effectiveness in collaborating with AI tools.

Video Requirements (50%)
Submit a 5-minute walkthrough video.
First, briefly explain the main failure risks in ERP integrations, including why idempotency is
critical and where integrations typically break.
Second, provide a focused architecture walkthrough covering your data model, idempotency
strategy, transaction handling, duplicate prevention, and referential integrity. Include a short
demo of real API calls.
Third, demonstrate key failure and edge cases such as duplicate invoices, missing vendors,
invalid tax codes, and VAT mismatches, and explain the expected system behavior.
Finally, outline at least three concrete production improvements you would implement.
Also include a short written self-critique addressing:
● What would likely fail in production?
● What would you refactor first?
● What technical debt did you consciously accept?

Additionally, include a brief note explaining whether and how you used AI tools during this
assignment, and how you validated or adjusted any AI-generated output.

We care far more about how you think about integration reliability, data integrity, and
production systems than about framework choice or perfectly polished, fully complete code.
